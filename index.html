            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There are all sorts of strands of creativity that contributed to what we now call electronic music. Even
                in the
                19th century, Italian futurists
                were experimenting with electronically produced sounds. In the 1940's, magnetic audio tape became to be
                used
                (abused?) by modifying speed of recording of playback, reversing
                the tape, and cutting it together from <b>found sounds</b>. In the 1950's the first instances of
                algorithmically
                produced sounds - those generated by a computer program, first appeared.
            <blockquote>
                "I was never worried that synthesizers would replace musicians. First of all, you have to be a musician
                in order to make music with a synthesizer."

            <h2>Types of Modern Electronic Music</h2>
            <p>Electronic music these days is created using a variety of techniques. One useful distinction is between
                <b>analog</b> and <b>digitally</b> produced music.

            <dl>
                <dt>Analog Music</dt>
                <dd>Analog Music is created by by electronic components (detailed below), that modify, amplify, and
                    filter
                    electronic
                    oscillations that produce the common basis of auditory information.</dd>
                <dt>Digital Music</dt>
                <dd>Digital Music is often created by microprocessors <i>simulating</i> the components of analog music
                    production
                    inside of a computer. These computers run software
                    (a DAW) that is designed for the design, sequencing, and arranging of electronic music. </dd>

            <h2>Components of Electronic Music Sound</h2>
            <p>The following is a list of some of the components that make up electronic music:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Oscillators</dt>
                <dd>Oscillators provide a variety of waveforms. Waveforms are patterns of electronic signal that can
                    be
                    made
                    audible.</dd>

                </figure>


                <dt>Filters</dt>
                <dd>Filters remove portions of the waveform generated by an oscillator, changing the tone, or shape
                    of
                    the
                    waveform.</dd>

                <dt>Voltage Controlled Amplifier (VCA)</dt>
                <dd>An amplifier for a signal that varies it's gain depending on a control source.</dd>
